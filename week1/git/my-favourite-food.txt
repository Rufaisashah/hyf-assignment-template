Ingredients
For the Chicken Marinade:

500g chicken (bone-in or boneless, cut into medium pieces)

½ cup plain yogurt

2 tbsp ginger-garlic paste

1 tsp red chili powder

½ tsp turmeric powder

1 tsp garam masala

1 tsp salt

Juice of half a lemon

A handful of chopped mint & coriander leaves

For the Rice:

2 cups basmati rice (soaked for 30 minutes)

6 cups water

2–3 cloves

2 cardamoms

1 bay leaf

½ tsp salt

For the Biryani Masala:

2 tbsp ghee or oil

2 medium onions (thinly sliced)

1 tomato (chopped)

1 cinnamon stick

2 cloves

1 cardamom

1 green chili (optional)

A few mint & coriander leaves for layering

Saffron strands soaked in 2 tbsp warm milk (optional but gives great aroma)

🍳 Method
Step 1: Marinate the Chicken

In a bowl, combine all marinade ingredients.

Mix well, cover, and refrigerate for at least 1 hour (preferably 4–6 hours).

Step 2: Cook the Rice

Boil water with salt and whole spices.

Add soaked rice and cook until 70% done (grain should still be slightly firm).

Drain and set aside.

Step 3: Fry the Onions

Heat ghee/oil in a large heavy-bottomed pan.

Fry the sliced onions until golden brown and crisp.

Remove half for garnishing later.

Step 4: Cook the Chicken

In the same pan with remaining onions, add the marinated chicken.

Cook until chicken is almost done and oil starts separating.

Add chopped tomato and cook for 5 minutes.

Step 5: Layer the Biryani

Remove half of the chicken masala from the pan.

Layer half of the cooked rice on top of the remaining chicken.

Add mint, coriander, fried onions, and saffron milk.

Add the remaining chicken and rice on top and repeat the garnish.

Step 6: Dum (Steam) Cooking

Stovetop method:
Cover the pan tightly with dough or a lid and cook on low heat for 20–25 minutes.

Oven method:
Cover with foil and bake at 180°C (350°F) for 25 minutes.
